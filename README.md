# Automating GIS with Python:
This jupyter binder was created to share a basic python environment across platforms that can be used to automate common gis tasks. 
This opens up the possibility to share powerful tools worldwide, automate analyses, automate data processing and collection, and much more. 

## For the pin-up, please start by opening up the Automating GIS with Python notebook. Later we will take a look at the revisions.
