# Automating GIS with Python:
This jupyter binder was created to share a basic python environment across platforms that can be used to automate common gis tasks. 
This opens up the possibility to share powerful tools worldwide, automate analyses, automate data processing and collection, and much more. 

## For the pin-up, please start by opening up the Automating GIS with Python Revisions notebook. It may take a few minutes to load. Once it loads, you do not need to do anything. I am going to walk you through an example before we use the notebook.

## Goals
- Testing Binder
- Scripting Census table downloads from the Census API and FTP site for Tigerline files. 
- Creating Interactive maps
- Exporting modified data for use in Arcmap

###*It is also important to note that the script pulls data from a filepath that is only accessible while running the script through the Binder itself.
