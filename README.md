# Automating GIS with Python:
This jupyter binder was created to share a basic python environment across platforms that can be used to automate common gis tasks. 
This opens up the possibility to share powerful tools worldwide, automate analyses, automate data processing and collection, and much more. 

## Goals
- Testing Binder
- Scripting Census table downloads from the Census API and FTP site for Tigerline files. 
- Creating Interactive maps
- Exporting modified data for use in Arcmap

## For the pin-up, please use the Automating GIS with Python notebook
