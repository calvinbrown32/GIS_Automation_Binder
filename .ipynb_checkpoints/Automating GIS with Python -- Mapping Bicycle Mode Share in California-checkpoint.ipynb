    "#### This notebook walks viewers through a simple Python script that 1. Downloads census commute to work mode choice data, 2. Cleans the downloaded census data and joins it to census cartographic boundary census tract spatial data, and 3. Creates a Folium choropleth map showing the commute to work mode share by census tract for user elected California counties. Press **SHIFT + ENTER**  \n",

    "#### Steps:\n",
    "1. Choose the counties that you would like to study. The script defaults to pulling data for Sacramento, Yolo, Sutter, and Yuba County census tracts.\n",
    "2. Import the required libraries and download commute to work mode share data from the Census data API.\n",
    "3. Clean the data and join it with Census Cartographic Boundary Census Tract Spatial Data.\n",
    "4. Create a map of the bicycle mode share within the chosen study counties using Folium and render the map.\n"
